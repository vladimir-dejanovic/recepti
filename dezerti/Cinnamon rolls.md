Fluffy cinnamon rolls smothered in cream cheese frosting are an American classic. The dough is slowly risen with an overnight stay in the fridge, which has two benefits: firstly, chilled dough is more manageable for rolling and shaping, and secondly the rolls will be ready in time for brunch!


## Ingredients

- 400g/14oz strong white flour, plus extra for dusting
- 100g/3½oz wholemeal flour
- 50g/1¾oz soft light brown sugar
- 1 tsp fine salt
- 7g sachet fast-action dried yeast
- 300ml/½ pint whole milk, at hand temperature
- 1 large free-range egg
- 50g/1¾oz very soft unsalted butter, diced, plus extra for greasing
- vegetable oil, for greasing

### For the cinnamon filling

- 200g/7oz soft light brown sugar
- 125g/4½oz soft unsalted butter
- 2 tbsp ground cinnamon
- 2 tbsp plain or strong flour

### For the cream cheese icing

- 100g/3½oz full fat cream cheese
- 25g/1oz very soft unsalted butter
- 125g/4½oz icing sugar, sifted
- ½ tsp vanilla paste or extract


## Method

1. Put  the flours, sugar, salt and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted  with a dough hook, and give a quick stir to combine. Add the milk and  egg and knead for 10 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic.  Add the butter, a lump at a time, and once all the butter has been  worked into the dough, knead for another 10 minutes. You can knead by  hand but expect the process to take longer.
2. Lightly  grease a large, clean bowl with a little oil, add the dough and cover  with a clean tea towel. Leave at room temperature for 1 hour, then put  the bowl in the fridge and leave overnight.
3. The  next day, lightly grease a baking tin roughly 20 x 30cm/8 x 12in (or a  little larger) with butter and line the base with baking parchment. 
4. On  a lightly floured surface, roll the cold dough out to a 45cm/18in  square. Mash together the cinnamon filling ingredients, then spread  evenly over the dough. Roll up the dough into a tight sausage and cut  into 12 equal slices. Place the slices, cut-side up, in the prepared tin  and cover with a damp tea towel. Leave for 1 hour at room temperature  until the buns have puffed up (they won’t double in size).
5. Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5. Bake the buns for 18–25 minutes until golden brown. Place on a wire rack to cool.
6. For  the icing, mash the cream cheese and butter together, then beat in the  icing sugar and vanilla until smooth. For a glossy glaze leave at room  temperature, or refrigerate for a firmer frosting-style finish. Spread  generously over the cooled buns.


## Recipe Tips

If you really want to get ahead, you can keep the dough in the fridge for 2 nights.
